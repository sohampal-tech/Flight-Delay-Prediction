# Flight-Delay-Prediction

Flight Delay Prediction (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Data)
This project uses real-world U.S. airline delay data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a flight will be delayed or not. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling using only Python.

Problem Statement
Flight delays impact travelers, logistics, and the economy.
Using data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, we built a system that predicts if a flight will be delayed based on key historical indicators.
